## Author's message

Author wishes to give thanks and salute both `ChangeNow` & `CloudFlare` platforms and services, also all amzing opensource libraries used to write & build this code.

Author does not have any gain or referral benefit in this App installations and the whole process (because ChangeNow embeds an IFrame with this widget) is happening on ChangeNow servers by your own API key and all the benefits and earned Bitcoins therefore belong to you and does not concern this App or it's author.
